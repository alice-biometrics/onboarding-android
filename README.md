Alice Android SDK is a collection of software development tools to integrate Alice Onboarding.

Its main features are:

- Automatic capture of documents and video selfie of the user in real time from the camera of your device.
- Communication with the onboarding API to facilitate rapid integration and development.
- Management of the onboarding flow configuration: requested documents and order.

This repository serves as an example of how to integrate Alice's SDK into an application.
